# ðŸ˜ŽMemeable (React Native, Express, MongoDB)
A social-media-like mobile app for posting and viewing memes. Unlike the
previous project using Firebase service as the backend, I'm using Express
to build some API for handling all the request (local development).

The authentication uses the JWT-based method to handle login and register.
Local login using Email&Password and Google login is supported. If user is
authenticated, they will receive a JWT token from the server for subsequent
actions. Refresh token mechanism is also implenmented to keep user logged in.

Still under development.
